# VAR Fairness Audit: Detecting Bias in Football Officiating
**A Comprehensive Data Science Investigation | DS 112 Final Project**

*Diego Sanchez | Stanford University | Department of Data Science*

## 🏆 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of potential bias in Video Assistant Referee (VAR) decisions in professional football. Using statistical methods, machine learning, and advanced visualization techniques, we analyzed 202 VAR incidents from the 2023-2024 season to investigate whether team characteristics influence decision favorability.

**Key Finding**: Top-tier teams received 15% more favorable decisions than bottom-tier teams, with penalty decisions showing a striking 32.8% disparity.

## 📊 Research Questions
1. Do higher-ranked teams receive more favorable VAR decisions?
2. Does the incident type affect the likelihood of favorable decisions?
3. Is there evidence of systemic bias in VAR decision-making over time?
4. What team characteristics best predict favorable VAR decisions?
